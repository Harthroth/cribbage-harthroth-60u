# **Cribbage**

## **How to Play**

### **The Beginning**
Each player begins the round with six cards, the game determines a starting "dealer" before play. Each player will put two of their six cards into a "crib" deck, which can be used for scoring by the dealer later. Then one card from the top of the deck is flipped up, which will be used in scoring for later. If the turn up card is a jack, the dealer gets 1 point.

### **The Play - Pegging**
 The players then take turns placing cards, starting with the dealer. If the cards add up to fifteen, the player who placed the last card gets two points. The cards cannot add up to more than thirty-one. The last player to place a card gets one point unless the pile adds up to exactly 31, then they get two points. The following scores for pairs, three of a kind, four of a kind, and runs also apply during pegging, with the player that places the card making the sequence of cards getting the points.

 ### **Final Scoring**
 Players then score their piles with the card flipped earlier. Scoring goes as follows.
 
 - Any combination adding to fifteen - 2 points each
 - Flush of four or five cards - 4 or 5 points respectively
 - Runs of three, four, or five cards - 3, 4, or 5 points respectively
 - Pairs - 2 points each
 - Three of a Kind - 6 points
 - Four of a Kind - 12 points

Here are some interesting card combinations

 - A run of three, with one card duplicated (double run) - 8 points
 - A run of four, with one card duplicated - 10 points
 - A run of three, with one card triplicated (triple run) - 15 points
 - A run of three, with two different cards duplicated - 16 points
 
 Twenty-nine is the highest possible score.

 The dealer also gets to score on the crib the same way. The game continues until either player reaches 61 or 121 points, depending on the game type. The dealer position switches back and forth each round.
